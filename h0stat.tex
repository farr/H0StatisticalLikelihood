\begin{abstract}
%
  We derive the likelihood function for a ``statistical'' measurement of the
  Hubble constant that combines a distance measured by a \ac{GW} observation and
  a catalog of redshifts from possible host galaxies measured by \ac{EM}
  observations.
%
\end{abstract}

\section{Likelihood}

We have two data sets: a \ac{GW} set $\dGW$, corresponding to a single detected
\ac{GW} event, and an \ac{EM} data set $\dEM$, corresponding to a survey of
galaxies that overlaps on the sky with the \ac{GW} event's inferred sky
position.  A likelihood function describes the generation of the \ac{GW} data
given \ac{GW} parameters $\thetaGW$ such as masses, spins, etc:
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}\left( \thetaGW \right) \equiv p\left( \dGW \mid \thetaGW \right).
\end{equation}
%
Crucially, the luminosity distance to the event, $d_L$, and the position of the
event on the sky $\OGW$ are among the \ac{GW} parameters.  Similarly, we have an
\ac{EM} likelihood that describes the generation of the survey data given
parameters for the galaxies in the survey:
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} \left( \thetaEM \right) \equiv p\left( \dEM \mid \thetaEM \right).
\end{equation}
%
Among the parameters for the \ac{EM} survey are the redshifts of the galaxies
$\left\{ z_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\}$ and also the positions of the
galaxies on the sky $\left\{ \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\}$.

The joint likelihood for the two sets of observations is just the product of the
individual likelihoods because the data generating processes in each instrument
are independent of each other:
%
\begin{equation}
    p\left( \dGW, \dEM \mid \thetaGW, \thetaEM \right) =  p\left( \dGW \mid \thetaGW \right) p\left( \dEM \mid \thetaEM \right).
\end{equation}
%
To measure the Hubble constant, we will not be concerned with the masses, spins,
etc, of the \ac{GW} source, nor with \ac{EM} data besides the redshifts and sky
positions, so let us impose some standard priors and integrate these variables
out.  This leaves us with a \emph{marginal} likelihood for each observation
expressed in terms of the luminosity distance, sky positions, and redshifts:
%
\begin{multline}
    p\left( \dGW \mid d_L, \OGW \right) p\left( \dEM \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\} \right) = \\ \int \dd \bar{\theta}_{\mathrm{GW}} \, \dd \bar{\theta}_{\mathrm{EM}} \, p\left( \bar{\theta}_{\mathrm{GW}} \right) p\left( \bar{\theta}_{\mathrm{EM}} \right) p\left( \dGW \mid \thetaGW \right) p\left( \dEM \mid \thetaEM \right),
\end{multline}
%
where the ``bar'' indicates the set of ignorable parameters and $p\left(
\bar{\theta}_{\mathrm{GW}} \right)$ and $p\left( \bar{\theta}_{\mathrm{EM}}
\right)$ are the priors we impose on these parameters.

Now let us impose the constraint that one of the galaxies in the survey must
have hosted the \ac{GW} event; suppose that we weight the choice of hosts by a
set of weights $\left\{ w_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\}$.  This
constraint will tie together both pairs $\OGW$ and $\Omega_i$ and $d_L$ and
$z_i$; the relation between $d_L$ and $z_i$ depends on $H_0$ (and other
cosmological parameters).  We can use these relationships to marginalize over
(i.e.\ eliminate) $d_L$ and $\OGW$ from the likelihood, obtaining for a single
galaxy host, $i$
%
%\begin{multline}
%    p\left( \dGW, \dEM \mid i, z_i, \Omega_i, H_0 \right) \equiv \\ \int \dd d_L \, \dd \OGW \, p\left( \dGW \mid d_L, \OGW \right) p\left( \dEM \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\} \right)  \\ \times \delta\left( d_L - d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right) \right) \delta \left( \OGW - \Omega_i \right).
%\end{multline}
%
%
\begin{multline}
    p\left( \dGW \mid i, z_i, \Omega_i, H_0 \right) \equiv \\ \int \dd d_L \, \dd \OGW \, p\left( \dGW \mid d_L, \OGW \right)  \delta\left( d_L - d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right) \right) \delta \left( \OGW - \Omega_i \right).
\end{multline}
%
The integrals are trivial, leaving
%
%\begin{multline}
%    p\left( \dGW, \dEM \mid i, z_i, \Omega_i, H_0 \right) = \\ p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_i \right) p\left( \dEM \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\} \right).
%\end{multline}
\begin{equation}
    p\left( \dGW \mid i, z_i, \Omega_i, H_0 \right) = p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_i \right).
\end{equation}

In the absence of other information, we do not know which galaxy hosted the
\ac{GW} event, so we should marginalize over the choice of galaxy, $i$, with the
correct weights:
%
%\begin{multline}
%    p\left( \dGW, \dEM \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\}, H_0 \right) = \\ \sum_{i = 1}^{\Ngal} w_i  p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_i \right) p\left( \dEM \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\} \right).
%\end{multline}
\begin{multline}
    p\left( \dGW \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\}, H_0 \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^{\Ngal} w_i  p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_i \right).
\end{multline}
%
Note that this is just the GW part of the likelihood, and it depends on the true redshifts and sky locations of the host galaxies. The galaxy redshifts and sky positions are nuisance parameters in an inference of $H_0$ so we should marginalize over them with a suitable choice of
prior, but first we must specify the EM likelihood since this also depends on those parameters. We assume that the EM data consists of independent measurements for each galaxy in the catalogue, with perfect sky location determination and imperfect redshift determination, i.e.,
\begin{multline}
p\left( \dEM \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\} \right) = \prod_{j=1}^{\Ngal} \delta(\Omega_{j,obs}-\Omega_j) p(z_{j,obs} | z_j, \Omega_j)
\end{multline}
in which we have now replaced $\dEM$ by individual estimated sky locations, $\Omega_{i,obs}$, and redshifts, $z_{i,obs}$, for each galaxy $i$. To marginalise the true redshift and sky location out of the likelihood we need to specify a prior on these parameters. A natural prior would be to assume that galaxies are uniformly distributed in comoving volume and on the sky, so
%
\begin{equation}
    p\left( z_i, \Omega_i \right) \dd z_i \, \dd \Omega_i = \frac{1}{4\pi V_\mathrm{max}} \diff{V}{z_i} \, \dd z_i \, \dd \Omega_i
\end{equation}
%
where $V_\mathrm{max}$ is some suitably large comoving volume that encompasses
all galaxies in the survey.  At sufficiently small redshifts, $p\left( z_i
\right) \propto z_i^2$.  Note that at \emph{all} redshifts, $p\left( z_i
\right)$ is independent of $H_0$.

The above prior is needed for each galaxy and the combined prior for all galaxies is therefore $\prod_j p(z_j, \Omega_j)$. Finally, we arrive at the marginal likelihood for $H_0$ given the joint observations:
%
\begin{multline}
    p\left( \dGW, \dEM \mid H_0 \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\Ngal} w_i \prod_j \int \dd z_j \, \dd \Omega_j \, p\left( z_j, \Omega_j \right) p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_i \right) \\ \times \delta(\Omega_{j,obs}-\Omega_j) p(z_{j,obs} | z_j, \Omega_j) \\
    = \sum_{i=1}^{\Ngal} w_i \prod_j \int \dd z_j \, p\left( z_j, \Omega_{j,obs} \right) p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_{i,obs} \right) \\ \times p(z_{j,obs} | z_j, \Omega_{j,obs}) .
\end{multline}
The GW data term depends only on the galaxy $i$ appearing in the sum. Therefore, most of the integrals can be evaluated directly. We introduce the evidences
\begin{equation}
{\cal Z}_j = \int p(z_{j,obs} | z, \Omega_{j,obs}) p\left( z, \Omega_{j,obs} \right) dz
\end{equation}
and then the previous expression reduces to
\begin{multline}
    \label{eq:H0-marginal-likelihood}
    p\left( \dGW, \dEM \mid H_0 \right) \propto  \sum_{i=1}^{\Ngal} w_i  \int \dd z \, \frac{p\left( z, \Omega_{i,obs} \right) p(z_{i,obs} | z, \Omega_{i,obs}) } {{\cal Z}_i} \\ \times p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z, H_0 \right), \Omega_{i,obs} \right).
\end{multline}
The first term inside the integral is the posterior on the true redshift of galaxy $i$ based on the EM data and so this can be interpreted as using the EM data as a prior on the possible redshifts of the host of the GW source.

\subsection{Selection Effects}

So far, we have been ignoring selection effects.  Selection effects can be
modeled by including a factor, $\beta\left( H_0 \right)$ ensuring that the
marginal likelihood integrates to one over all \emph{detectable} data sets
\citep{Mandel2018}.  In other words, we write
%
\begin{multline}
    p\left( \dGW, \dEM \mid H_0 \right) = \frac{1}{\beta\left( H_0 \right)} \sum_{i=1}^{\Ngal} w_i \int \dd z_i \, \dd \Omega_i \, p\left( z_i, \Omega_i \right) p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_i \right) \\ \times p\left( \dEM \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\} \right)
\end{multline}
%
such that
\begin{equation}
    \int \dd \dGW \, \dd \dEM \, \Pdet\left( \dGW \right) \Pdet\left( \dEM \right) p\left( \dGW, \dEM \mid H_0 \right) = 1,
\end{equation}
%
where $\Pdet\left(d\right)$ refers to the probability that a particular data set
$d$ will result in a ``detection'' of a \ac{GW} (typically, $\Pdet$ is either 0
or 1, depending on the output of a pipeline applied to the data; it serves to
truncate the integral to detectable data sets only).  Thus,
%
\begin{multline}
    \label{eq:beta-H0-full-def}
    \beta\left( H_0 \right) =  \int \dd \dGW \, \dd \dEM \, \Pdet\left( \dGW \right) \Pdet\left( \dEM \right) \\ \times \sum_{i=1}^{\Ngal} w_i \int \dd z_i \, \dd \Omega_i \, p\left( z_i, \Omega_i \right) p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_i \right) \\ \times p\left( \dEM \mid \left\{ z_i, \Omega_i \mid i = 1, \ldots, \Ngal \right\} \right).
\end{multline}
%
Note that the issue of selection effects has nothing to do with how
``detectable'' the observed events are (by definition, in the absence of a
stochastic detection pipeline, $\Pdet\left( d_{\mathrm{GW},\mathrm{observed}}
\right) \equiv 1$), but rather how the detectability of the \emph{population} of
\ac{GW} events varies with $H_0$.

Current catalogs are complete (i.e.\ $\Pdet\left( \dEM \right) = 1$) for any
\ac{GW} detection assuming reasonable values of $H_0$.  In this document we
assume that the galaxy catalog is selected from a flux-limited survey, so (to
sufficient approximation) it is complete to some $d_{L, \mathrm{max}}$; this
corresponds to a $z_{\mathrm{max}}\left( d_{L,\mathrm{max}}, H_0 \right)$ that
depends on $H_0$.  An alternative perspective is to assume that the catalogs are
complete to some redshift $z_\mathrm{max}$ in which case
$d_{L,\mathrm{max}}\left( z_\mathrm{max}, H_0 \right)$ depends on $H_0$.  Final
expressions for the likelihood are identical between these two approaches, but
intermediate expressions differ in some places, as I note below.

Performing the integral over $\dEM$ (remember that the \ac{EM} likelihood is
normalised), we obtain
%
\begin{multline}
    \beta\left( H_0 \right) =  \int \dd \dGW \, \Pdet\left( \dGW \right) \\ \times \sum_{i=1}^{\Ngal} w_i \int \dd z_i \, \dd \Omega_i \, p\left( z_i, \Omega_i \right) p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z_i, H_0 \right), \Omega_i \right).
\end{multline}
%
The integrals in each term of the sum are now all identical (only the \ac{EM}
data distinguishes the different galaxies) and the sum over weights is
normalized, so we are left with
%
\begin{equation}
     \beta\left( H_0 \right) =  \int \dd \dGW \, \dd z \, \dd \Omega \, \Pdet\left( \dGW \right)  p\left( z, \Omega \right) p\left( \dGW \mid d_L\left( z, H_0 \right), \Omega \right).
\end{equation}
%
We can change variables from $z$ to $d_L$ in the integral, and integrate up to
the $\ac{GW}$ horizon, $d_{L,\mathrm{max},\mathrm{GW}}$, where $\Pdet\left( \dGW
\right) \to 0$, obtaining
%
\begin{equation}
    \beta\left( H_0 \right) =  \int \dd \dGW \, \dd d_L \, \dd \Omega \, \Pdet\left( \dGW \right)  p\left( d_L, \Omega \right) p\left( \dGW \mid d_L, \Omega \right) = \frac{V \left( d_{L,\mathrm{max},\mathrm{GW}} \right)}{V\left( d_{L,\mathrm{max}} \right)}
\end{equation}
%
But this latter integral is independent of $H_0$ for Euclidean universes, and
weakly dependent at larger distances under our assumption that the catalog is
complete to some fixed $d_{L, \mathrm{max}}$, so $\beta\left( H_0 \right) \simeq
\mathrm{const}$; had we assumed instead a maximum redshift for completeness,
then $d_{L, \mathrm{max}}$ depends on $H_0$ and $\beta\left( H_0 \right) \propto
H_0^3$ as in \citet{Fishbach2018}.

Eventually, \ac{EM} catalogs will not be complete for all \ac{GW} events.  If
only the set of \ac{GW} events for which the \ac{EM} catalog is complete is used
to estimate $H_0$ then $\beta\left( H_0 \right)$ can be computed by returning to
Eq.\ \eqref{eq:beta-H0-full-def}.  Alternately, the full set of \ac{GW} events
can be used, and a fictitious catalog members can be added with weights
corresponding to the incompleteness fraction at various redshifts and in
different directions; the limit of this procedure yields the formulas in
\citet{Fishbach2018} for incomplete catalogs.

\section{Practical Considerations}

Evaluating Eq.\ \eqref{eq:H0-marginal-likelihood} requires the ability to
compute the \ac{GW} marginal likelihood at arbitrary $d_L$ and $\Omega$.
Happily, a standard data product provided by LIGO \citep{Singer2016} can be
adapted to produce a function that approximates the marginal \ac{GW} likelihood
at fixed locations on the sky corresponding to HEALPix pixels
\citep{Gorski2005}.  The method in \citet{Singer2016} fits the \emph{posterior}
over distance and sky position from a LIGO analysis using a per-pixel ansatz
where
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:gtd-ansatz}
    p\left( d_L, \Omega \mid \dGW \right) = \frac{\rho_i}{A} \frac{N_i}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_i} \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d_L-\mu_i}{\sigma_i}\right)^2 \right] d_L^2,
\end{equation}
%
with $\Omega$ in HEALPix pixel $i$; $N_i$, $\rho_i$, $\mu_i$, and $\sigma_i$
per-pixel fitting parameters; and $A$ the area of the pixel.  Since the standard
LIGO distance prior is proportional to $d_L^2$, this means that the \ac{GW}
marginal likelihood when $\Omega$ is in pixel $i$ is (up to ignorable constants)
%
\begin{equation}
    p\left( \dGW \mid d_L, \Omega \right) \propto \frac{\rho_i}{A} \frac{N_i}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_i} \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d_L-\mu_i}{\sigma_i}\right)^2 \right].
\end{equation}
%
(Note the missing factor of $d_L^2$ relative to Eq.\ \eqref{eq:gtd-ansatz}.)

If we are in the linear regime, where
%
\begin{equation}
    d_L = \frac{c z}{H_0}
\end{equation}
%
to sufficient accuracy, the \ac{EM} likelihood is Gaussian in the redshift,
%
\begin{equation}
    p\left( \dEM \mid z_i, \Omega_i \right) \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_{z,i}} \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{z_i - z_{i,\mathrm{obs}}}{\sigma_{i,z}} \right)^2 \right],
\end{equation}
%
and we assume that the \ac{EM} data determines the sky position of each galaxy
precisely, then the marginalization integrals over redshift and sky position in
Eq.\ \eqref{eq:H0-marginal-likelihood} can be performed analytically, as we now
show. The evidence integral, assuming a $p\left( z_i \right) \propto z_i^2$
prior becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{Z}_i = \int \dd z_i \, z_i^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_{z,i}} \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{z_i - z_{i,\mathrm{obs}}}{\sigma_{i,z}} \right)^2 \right] = \sigma_{i,z}^2 + z_{i,\mathrm{obs}}^2.
\end{equation}
%
The result, when galaxy $i$ lies inside pixel $k_i$, is
%
\begin{multline}
     p\left( \dGW \mid \dEM, H_0 \right) = \\ \frac{3 H_0^3}{z_\mathrm{max}^3} \sum_{i=1}^{\Ngal} \frac{w_i \rho_{k_i} N_{k_i}}{A \sqrt{2\pi} \Sigma \mathcal{Z}_i} \exp\left[ -\frac{\left(H_0 \mu_{k_i} - c z_{i,\mathrm{obs}}\right)^2}{2 \Sigma^2} \right] \\ \times \left( \frac{\sigma_{k_i}^2 \sigma_{i,z}^2}{\Sigma^2} + \frac{\left( c \mu_{k_i} \sigma_{i,z}^2 + H_0 \sigma_{k_i}^2 z_{i,\mathrm{obs}} \right)^2}{\Sigma^4} \right),
\end{multline}
%
with
%
\begin{equation}
    \Sigma^2 = H_0^2 \sigma_{k_i}^2 + c^2 \sigma_{i,z}^2.
\end{equation}
%
We are assuming that the galaxy catalog is complete to some $d_{L,
\mathrm{max}}$, so the factor $H_0/z_\mathrm{max}$ is independent of $H_0$ and
equal to $c/d_\mathrm{max}$:
%
\begin{multline}
  p\left( \dGW \mid \dEM, H_0\right) = \\ \frac{3 c^3}{d_{L,\mathrm{max}}^3} \sum_{i=1}^{\Ngal} \frac{w_i \rho_{k_i} N_{k_i}}{A \sqrt{2\pi} \Sigma \mathcal{Z}_i} \exp\left[ -\frac{\left(H_0 \mu_{k_i} - c z_{i,\mathrm{obs}}\right)^2}{2 \Sigma^2} \right] \\ \times \left( \frac{\sigma_{k_i}^2 \sigma_{i,z}^2}{\Sigma^2} + \frac{\left( c \mu_{k_i} \sigma_{i,z}^2 + H_0 \sigma_{k_i}^2 z_{i,\mathrm{obs}} \right)^2}{\Sigma^4} \right).
\end{multline}
%
If, alternately, we had assumed that the catalog is complete to some
$z_\mathrm{max}$ then $\beta\left( H_0 \right) \propto H_0^3$ and this factor
would cancel the $H_0^3$ in the numerator, again leading to a likelihood that
lacks a pre-factor dependent on $H_0$.  Both approaches agree on the likelihood
\emph{when the selection effects are dominated by the \ac{GW} horizon}.

It is reasonable to truncate the sum above by ignoring galaxies for which
$\rho_{k_i}$ (the integrated per-pixel \ac{GW} posterior probability) is
sufficiently small.

\subsection{The Uninformative Limit}

In the limit where the individual redshift measurements are too uncertain to
meaningfully constrain $H_0$, the measurement should be uninformative.  In this
limit
%
\begin{equation}
  H_0^2 \sigma_{k_i}^2 \ll c^2 \sigma_{z,i}^2 \to \infty
\end{equation}
%
in the relevant pixels.  Since the $c^2 \sigma_{i,z}^2$ term dominates $\Sigma$
and also eliminates the exponential, the likelihood function for $H_0$ becomes
constant and the measurement is uninformative about $H_0$.

\subsection{The Maximally Informative Limit}

Suppose there is only a single galaxy in the entire sky area (maybe our sky area
is very small, or maybe we have an \ac{EM} counterpart that eliminates all the
galaxies in the catalog but one).  Then the sum collapses to one term, and the
pixel-dependent parts become ignorable constants, so
%
\begin{multline}
  p\left( \dGW \mid \dEM, H_0 \right) \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \Sigma \mathcal{Z}_i} \exp\left[ -\frac{\left(H_0 \mu_{k_i} - c z_{i,\mathrm{obs}}\right)^2}{2 \Sigma^2} \right] \\ \times \left( \frac{\sigma_{k_i}^2 \sigma_{i,z}^2}{\Sigma^2} + \frac{\left( c \mu_{k_i} \sigma_{i,z}^2 + H_0 \sigma_{k_i}^2 z_{i,\mathrm{obs}} \right)^2}{\Sigma^4} \right).
\end{multline}
%
If we now imagine that $c \sigma_{i,z} \ll H_0 \sigma_{k_i}$ for all reasonable
values of $H_0$ and that $\sigma_{i,z} \ll z_{i,\mathrm{obs}}$, then we do not
distinguish any more between $z_{i,\mathrm{obs}}$ and $z_i$ and the likelihood
becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  p\left( \dGW \mid \dEM, H_0 \right) \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} H_0 \sigma_{k_i}} \exp\left[ -\frac{\left(H_0 \mu_{k_i} - c z_{i}\right)^2}{2 H_0^2 \sigma_{k_i}^2} \right] \left( \frac{1}{H_0^2} \right).
\end{equation}
%
If the \ac{GW} measurement becomes infinitely precise as well, then
$\sigma_{k_i} \to 0$, and the likelihood becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  p\left( \dGW \mid \dEM, H_0 \right) \propto \delta \left( H_0 \mu_{k_i} - c z_{i}\right) \left( \frac{1}{H_0^3} \right),
\end{equation}
%
which selects $H_0 = c z_i / \mu_{k_i}$ as expected.

\subsection{The Many Galaxies Limit}

Suppose there are so many galaxies within the \ac{GW} region on the sky that we
can treat them as being continuously distributed with density $p\left( z \right)
\propto z^2$.  To make the expressions tractable, suppose the measurement
uncertainty on redshift is small, $\sigma_{i,z} \to 0$ and that the \ac{GW}
source is localized to a single pixel $k$.  Then the \ac{GW} likelihood becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  p\left( \dGW \mid \dEM, H_0 \right) \propto \sum_i \frac{w_i}{\sqrt{2\pi} H_0^3 \sigma_k} \exp\left[ - \frac{\left( H_0 \mu_k - c z_i \right)^2}{2 H_0^2 \sigma_k^2} \right].
\end{equation}
%
Note that the evidence term $\mathcal{Z}_i$ has cancelled the $z_i^2$ appearing
from the prior we placed on the true redshift of each galaxy.  There are so many
galaxies that the sum over galaxies becomes an integral, leading to
%
\begin{equation}
  p\left( \dGW \mid \dEM, H_0 \right) \propto \int \dd z \, \frac{p(z)}{\sqrt{2\pi} H_0^3 \sigma_k} \exp\left[ - \frac{\left( H_0 \mu_k - c z \right)^2}{2 H_0^2 \sigma_k^2} \right] \propto \mathrm{const}.
\end{equation}
%
In other words, if the distribution of galaxies is uniform across the \ac{GW}
localization region then the measurement is uninformative.
